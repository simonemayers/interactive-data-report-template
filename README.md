# **Loan Repayment Analysis Project**

## **Project Overview**
This project explores a loan repayment dataset to identify key factors that influence whether borrowers default on their loans or successfully repay them. The analysis uses R for data manipulation, visualization, and identifying patterns that can help improve loan approval processes.

---

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset includes the following key variables:

- **ID**: Unique identifier for each borrower  
- **Occupation**: Industrial or professional sector  
- **Age**: Borrower's age  
- **Loan_Salary_Ratio**: Ratio of loan amount to salary  
- **Outcome**: Loan status (repaid or defaulted)  

A larger dataset is loaded using the `readr` package for more comprehensive analysis.

---

## **Tools & Libraries Used**
- R  
- `readr` for reading TSV files  
- DataFrame manipulation functions  

---

## **Project Goals**
- Identify patterns in borrower profiles related to default risks  
- Use insights to improve loan approval criteria  
- Develop predictive models for loan repayment behavior  

---

## **How to Run the Code**
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Ensure R and necessary packages (`readr`) are installed.  
3. Run the R script to load and analyze the dataset.

## **Next Steps**
- Expand the dataset with more variables (e.g., credit history).  
- Build predictive models using machine learning techniques.  
- Refine the analysis for better insights.
