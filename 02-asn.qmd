# Assignment Goal {.unnumbered}

The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your understanding of fundamentals of machine learning -- trade-off between prediction accuracy and model interpretability, supervised versus unsupervised learning, and regression versus classification problems. 

# Question: Simple Regression Models

Consider the following figure:

![](models.png)


Shown in the leftmost subfigure is the scatter plot of dataset. \emph{Age} is the predictor variable and \emph{Income} is the response/target variable. The next three subfigures are simple regression models which are referred to as $M_1$, $M_2$, and $M_3$. One of the models is an overfit, another is just right, and the remaining one is underfit. Which model is an overfit model? Underfit model? Just about right model? What is the basis for your answers?


**Answer:**



# Question: Consistent Prediction Models

Consider the training data shown below, in which **ID**, **Occupation**, **Age**, and **Loan-Salary Ratio** are the predictor variables, and **Outcome** is the response/target variable.


```{r}
#| echo: false
ID <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
Occupation <- c("industrial", "professional", "professional", "professional", "industrial ", "industrial", "professional", "professional", "industrial", "industrial")
Age <- c(34, 41, 36, 41, 48, 61, 37, 40, 33, 32)
Loan_Salary_Ratio <- c(2.96, 4.64, 3.22, 3.11, 3.80, 2.52, 1.50, 1.93, 5.25, 4.15)
Outcome <- c("repaid", "default", "default", "default", "default", "repaid", "repaid", "repaid", "default", "default")
df <- data.frame(ID, Occupation, Age, Loan_Salary_Ratio, Outcome)
# print(df)
```

<!--

# replace _ in column names by a space
knitr::kable(iris2, col.names = gsub("[_]", " ", names(iris)))

knitr::kable(iris, col.names = c('We', 'Need', 'Five', 'Names', 'Here'))
-->


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap-location: margin
knitr::kable(df, caption = 'A machine learning application dataset.', col.names = gsub("[_]", " ", names(df)), align = "rlccl")
```


Next consider the following prediction model (called $M_1$), which is developed using the data in the table above:

```
if Loan-Salary Ratio > 3 then
    Outcome=’default’
else
    Outcome=’repay’
end if
```

Why is this model a consistent prediction model? Explain. This model also uses two principles: feature design and feature selection. Explain these two principles.


# Question: Consistent Prediction Model

Consider the training data shown in the following table. ID, Amount, Salary, Ratio, Age, Occupation, House, and Type are predictor variables, and Outcome is the response/target variable.


```{r}
#| echo: false
# install readr, if not already installed
# install.packages("readr")
# load readr
library(readr)
df <- readr::read_tsv("./data.tsv", col_names = FALSE)
column_names <- c("ID", "Amount", "Salary", "Loan-Salary Ratio", "Age", "Occupation", "House", "Type", "Outcome")
colnames(df) <- column_names
print(df)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap-location: margin
knitr::kable(df, caption = 'Another machine learning application dataset.', col.names = gsub("[_]", " ", names(df)), align = "lrrcrrrrr")
```

Next consider the following prediction model (called $M_2$) which is developed using the data in the table above:

```
if Loan-Salary Ratio < 1.5 then
    Outcome=’repay’
else if Loan-Salary Ratio > 4 then
    Outcome=’default’
else if Age < 40 and Occupation =’industrial’ then
    Outcome=’default’
else
    Outcome=’repay’
end if
```

Is this model a consistent prediction model? Explain. Which model is better? $M_1$ or $M_2$. Why?



# Question: Classification or Regression?

Explain whether each scenario is a classification or regression problem.

## Scenario 1

We collect a set of data on the top 500 firms in the US. For each firm we record profit, number of employees, industry and the CEO salary. We are interested in understanding which factors affect CEO salary.

## Scenario 2 

We are considering launching a new product and wish to know whether it will be a success or a failure. We collect data on 20 similar products that were previously launched. For each product we have recorded whether it was a success or failure, price charged for the product, marketing budget, competition price, and ten other variables.
